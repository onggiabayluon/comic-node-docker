Let’s put an end to this nightmare.” The whole world celebrated the hero’s appearance, And I became his comrade. But… He wasn’t a hero nor a messiah like the world was hailing him. He was a deceitful hero with the secret ambition to rule the world. “You did well. If it weren’t for you, I couldn’t have come up till here.” I lost my life at his blade in the last dungeon. …or so i thought. The announcement I heard next to my ear the moment I died.
